# PM_Scheduling

This page contains the problem instances used in our ongoing research on identical parallel machine problem with minimization of the weighted total tardiness. 

For the training data, problem instances were generated for each number of machines (2, 3, and 5), considering different combinations of the number of jobs, processing times, weights, and due dates for n∈{10,25,50,100,150,200}, α∈{0,0.2,0.4,0.6}, and  β∈{0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8} with α<β. For each number of machines, a total of 60 problem instances were generated, resulting in 60 problem instances for each set (PM2, PM3, and PM5) which varied on the numbers of machines and jobs.
